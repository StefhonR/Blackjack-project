# BLACKJACK

 Hello! This is my Blackjack game. It sucks, but play it anyways!

 This project is the result of my blood sweat and tears. (alot of tears)

 But even in it broken state, I'm proud of the progess i've made!

 ## HOW TO PLAY?

 The game's objective is to be dealt cards having a higher count than those of the dealer, up to but not exceeding 21. The dealer may use a single deck of 52 cards or two or more decks from a holder called a shoe. Aces count as 1 or 11 (in this game Ace = 1), face cards as 10, and all others count at face value.

 To draw another card, press "Hit". To end your turn and let dealer draw, press "Stand". And to restart, press "New Game".


 ## HOW TO USE?

 Push the buttons man, what do you think? -_-


 ## IMPROVEMENTS
 Clearly my game isn't as good as it could be, so the improvements I plan on making is:

 1. The game displays dealer score from the start of the game, this shouldn't happen.
 2. Dealers face down card does not flip over.
 2. When starting new game without refreshing the page, the card deck doesn't reset properly. This causes the game to break after a few rounds. I need to make a reset deck function.
 3. I want the cards to appear before the game message displays, I also want the cards to appear more dynamically.

 ## STRETCH GOALS
 1. Hover styling for the buttons
 2. Dynamic "Lay Down" animations for the cards
 3. Visually appealling CSS styling
 4. Advanced JavaScript styling to add responsive background animation
 5. Maybe GIF animations on the side margins
